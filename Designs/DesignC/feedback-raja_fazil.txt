CS 4063/5063: Scoring & Comments for Homework - Design C
================================================================================

Score: 14 / 20      (Doesn't include late penalty, if any. See Canvas.)

==== Scoring ===================================================================

Submission [1 / 1]

[1 / 1]  Submitted file is .bmpr format; imports into Wireframes without error;
         included assets are appropriate, sufficient, and mostly/all necessary.

Collection, Editor & Parts Wireframes [5 / 5]

[1 / 1]  Submission contains wireframes called Collection and Editor, each in a
         window with a menubar and with pane content copied over from Design B.
[1 / 1]  Submission contains wireframe called Parts that includes distinct parts
         for four menus (showing their menu items) and four accordion states.
[1 / 1]  Menubar design contains all four menus; menus contain all specified
         items (at most one missing); most menu items have familiar shortcuts.
[1 / 1]  Accordion states each incorporate appropriate widgets for filtering.      
[1 / 1]  Other section of accordion is appropriately titled and allows sensible
         editing of value(s) for filtering on the chosen attribute. 

Task Flow Wireframe [3 / 5]

[1 / 1]  Submission contains a wireframe called Task Flow.
[1 / 1]  Task Flow uses reasonable elements for a box-and-arrow diagram.
[0 / 1]  Task Flow includes all 13 states for the specified storyboard task.
[0 / 1]  Boxes labeled as states. Four alternative interaction paths for steps
         3-7 are obvious and correctly match four most likely filtering orders.
[1 / 1]  Each box links to the corresponding duplicate wireframe.

Duplicate Wireframes [2 / 4]

[1 / 1]  A duplicate is included for each Task Flow box (all or all but one).
[1 / 1]  Duplicates are appropriately renamed and reasonably modified.
[0 / 1]  Markup is sufficient to understand each duplicate's interactions.
[0 / 1]  Each wireframe contains recognizable, functional forward and backward
         link(s) to appropriate step(s) in the task flow, plus Home links.

Design Analysis [3 / 5]

[1 / 1]  Hick's Law applied for File/Open menu item, with reasonable choices
         of number of levels and n for each level; work shown, correct result.
[1 / 1]  Hick's Law comment describes reasonable menu modification with helpful,
         objective analysis based on menu calculations.
[1 / 1]  Fitts' Law applied for one storyboard path (clearly identified), with
         reasonable choices of amplitude and effective width for all steps.
[0 / 1]  Fitts' Law calculation includes Hick's Law results and typing time;
         work shown, correct result.
[0 / 1]  Fitts' Law comment correctly identifies slowest step and describes
         reasonable, non-trivial layout modification with helpful, objective
         analysis of benefits and/or drawbacks based on movement calculations.

==== Comments ==================================================================

Hick's law results were not included in Fitts' calculations 
Modification and analysis for Fitts' law needs to be based off the slowest steps.
