CS 4063/5063: Scoring & Comments for Homework - Design B
================================================================================

Score: 15 / 20      (Doesn't include late penalty, if any. See Canvas.)

==== Scoring ===================================================================

Submission [2 / 2]

[1 / 1]  Submitted file is .bmpr format, imports into Wireframes without error.
[1 / 1]  Included assets are appropriate, sufficient, and mostly/all necessary.

Sketch, Collection & Editor Wireframes [3 / 3]

[1 / 1]  Submission contains wireframe called Sketch, Collection, and Editor,
         and all three wireframes are clearly matched to the corresponding tabs.
[1 / 1]  All three wireframes use reasonably simple elements to reproduce most
         UI items. (Moderately complex compositions for the cover flow is okay.)
[1 / 1]  UI items for table, cover flow, summary are reproduced recognizably
         using a Data Grid (or suitable substitute) with representative data.

Task Flow Wireframe [5 / 5]

[1 / 1]  Submission contains a wireframe called Task Flow.
[1 / 1]  Task Flow uses reasonable elements for a box-and-arrow diagram.
[1 / 1]  Boxes are labeled as states. Possible interaction paths are obvious.
[1 / 1]  Paths include a path with 8+ states for the specified storyboard task.
[1 / 1]  Each box links to the corresponding duplicate wireframe, for whichever
         duplicate wireframes were included in the submission (at least 4).

Duplicate Wireframes [3 / 5]

[1 / 1]  A duplicate is included for each Task Flow box (all or all but one).
[0 / 1]  Duplicates (>=4) are appropriately renamed and reasonably modified.
[1 / 1]  Markup is sufficient to understand each duplicate's interactions.
[0 / 1]  Each wireframe contains link(s) to following step(s) in the task flow.
[1 / 1]  Duplicates (>=4) have recognizable, functional Home and Back links.

Discovery & Wireframe Refinement [2 / 5]

[0 / 1]  Discovery approach followed requirements and produced useful data.
[0 / 1]  Three attributes reasonably chosen based on gathered information.
[1 / 1]  Table columns are included and reasonably designed for five attributes.
[1 / 1]  Summary design is reasonably refined based on discovery results.
[0 / 1]  Comment is objective and helps to understand discovery & refinement.

==== Comments ==================================================================

Missing the center movie label in cover flow.

Summary items should be populated in Sketch wireframe and A Beautiful mind row should be
populated in the table.

I recommend choosing each row in the table to be one full color, i.e the 2 Fast 2 Furious
row would be fully white and A Beautiful Mind would be fully gray, etc.

Your disoveery process should include interviewing other people
